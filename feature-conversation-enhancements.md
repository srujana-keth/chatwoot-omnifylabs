# Feature: Conversation Enhancements

## Summary of Changes

The `feature/conversation-enhancements` branch implements significant improvements to conversation analysis and display capabilities in the Chatwoot platform. The primary changes include:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Added a new service (`SentimentAnalyzerService`) that analyzes message content to determine sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)
   - Implemented keyword-based sentiment detection using predefined positive and negative keyword lists
   - Applied sentiment analysis to individual messages rather than entire conversations

2. **Language Detection**:
   - Added language detection capability to identify the language of messages
   - Integrated language information into the conversation data model

3. **Content Attributes Storage**:
   - Added a new `content_attributes` JSON column to the conversations table to store metadata like sentiment and language
   - Created migration to support this new data structure

4. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Updated the conversation header to display sentiment and language information
   - Added appropriate styling for different sentiment types
   - Implemented UI refreshing to update sentiment display in real-time

5. **API Enhancements**:
   - Exposed content attributes via widget APIs
   - Updated JSON builders to include the new attributes

6. **Background Processing**:
   - Created a `ConversationEnrichmentJob` to process conversations asynchronously

These enhancements provide agents with more context about conversations, enabling them to better understand customer sentiment and respond appropriately.
