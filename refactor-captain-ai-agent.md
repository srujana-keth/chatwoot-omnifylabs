# Refactor: Captain AI Agent

## Summary of Changes

The `refactor-captain-ai-agent` branch implements a comprehensive terminology change throughout the Chatwoot codebase, renaming key AI-related components for better clarity and branding. The changes occurred in two main phases:

1. **"Captain" to "AI Agent" Renaming**:
   - Renamed the "Captain" feature to "AI Agent" across the entire codebase
   - Updated all UI labels, menu items, and settings references
   - Modified file paths, component names, and API endpoints
   - Updated database migration files and schema references
   - Changed image assets and icons

2. **"Assistant" to "Topic" Renaming**:
   - Renamed the concept of "Assistant" to "Topic" throughout the application
   - Updated all related UI components, API endpoints, and database references
   - Modified file names and component hierarchies
   - Updated internationalization (i18n) files across all supported languages

This refactoring effort was purely terminological and did not change any functional behavior of the application. The goal was to establish more intuitive and descriptive naming conventions for the AI capabilities within the platform.

## Workflow Documentation

### Tools Used

#### 1. Code Analysis & Planning

- **RooCode**: Used to identify all occurrences of "Captain" and "Assistant" across the codebase
- **ChatGPT**: Helped create a comprehensive renaming strategy and identify potential issues

#### 2. Refactoring Assistance

- **Continue**: Assisted with bulk renaming operations and ensuring consistency
- **Gemini**: Helped validate the changes and identify missed references

#### 3. Testing & Validation

- **RooCode**: Used to verify that all references were updated correctly
- **ChatGPT**: Helped create test cases to ensure functionality remained intact

### Implementation Process

1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Used RooCode to generate a complete inventory of all "Captain" and "Assistant" references
   - Created a detailed mapping of old terms to new terms
   - Identified high-risk areas where renaming might cause issues

2. **"Captain" to "AI Agent" Refactoring**:
   - Initial commit (257d14b64): Performed the bulk of the renaming
     - Updated over 300 files across the codebase
     - Modified UI labels in all language files
     - Updated database migration files
     - Renamed API endpoints and controllers

3. **"Assistant" to "Topic" Refactoring**:
   - Follow-up commit (201f5067a): Completed the second phase of renaming
     - Updated component names and file paths
     - Modified UI labels and internationalization files
     - Updated database references and models
     - Renamed API endpoints and controllers

4. **Final Cleanup**:
   - Commit (beae6a2ae): Renamed remaining folders from "captain" to "ai_agent"
   - Commit (4e401b6ed): Final rename of "AI Assist" to "AI Agent" in remaining places

5. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Performed comprehensive testing to ensure all functionality remained intact
   - Verified that all UI elements displayed correctly with the new terminology
   - Confirmed that all API endpoints worked as expected
   - Validated database migrations and schema changes

This refactoring effort successfully established a more intuitive naming convention for the AI capabilities within the platform, improving clarity for both developers and end-users without disrupting any functionality.
